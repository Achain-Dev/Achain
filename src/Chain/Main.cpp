     * to exist and just shut down during global destructor, they will cancel their
     * log rotation tasks and the canceled_exceptions will trigger log_contexts to be
     * created.  These use fc::path which uses boost::filesystem::path, and that
     * uses global objects in boost for character set conversion.  Since we're linking
     * boost statically, we can't control the order global destructors run in, and
     * we have been crashing because the boost codecvt objects are already destroyed before
     * the file_appenders get destroyed.
     *
     * This could probably be resolved by linking boost dynamically.  This hack works,
     * but it prevents us from logging in global object destructors.  Probably we should
     * switch to dynamically linking in boost libraries.
