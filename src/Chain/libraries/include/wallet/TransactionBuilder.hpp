         * @brief The transaction_builder struct simplifies the process of creating arbitrarily complex transactions.
         *
         * The builder creates a transaction and allows an arbitrary number of operations to be added to this transaction by
         * subsequent calls to the Builder Functions. The builder is capable of dealing with operations from multiple
         * accounts, and the various accounts' credits and debits are not mixed. When the builder finalizes, it balances the
         * books by crediting or charging each account with only that account's outstanding balance.
         *
         * The same owner key is used for all market operations belonging to a single account. Different accounts have
         * different market owner keys. If a new market operation is added to the transaction, and that operation belongs to
         * an account which also has order cancellations or covers in this transaction, one of that account's cancellations
         * or covers is chosen arbitrarily and the new market operations are owned by that cancellation's owner key. If no
         * cancellations nor covers for that account exist at the time of building in the new market operation, a new key
         * pair is generated for the owning account and used as the owner key for subsequent market operations under that
         * account.
         *
         * The Builder Functions expect the wallet to be open and unlocked. Do not attempt to use a transaction_builder on a
         * wallet which is not unlocked. The functions make several other assumptions which must be validated before calling
         * the appropriate function. See the documentation for a given function to know exactly what assumptions it makes.
         * Calling a Builder Function with one of its assumptions being invalid yields undefined behavior.
